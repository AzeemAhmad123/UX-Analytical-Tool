CAN YOU ADD NODE.JS IN SITEGROUND APP INSTALLER?
================================================================================

SHORT ANSWER: ❌ NO

SiteGround's App Installer does NOT support custom Node.js applications.

================================================================================
WHAT APP INSTALLER SUPPORTS
================================================================================

SiteGround's App Installer (Devs → App Installer) is designed for:

✅ PRE-BUILT PHP APPLICATIONS:
   - WordPress
   - Joomla (3.x & 4.x)
   - Drupal
   - PrestaShop
   - WooCommerce

❌ DOES NOT SUPPORT:
   - Custom Node.js applications
   - React backends
   - Express.js APIs
   - Any custom server-side JavaScript

================================================================================
WHY IT DOESN'T WORK
================================================================================

1. App Installer only recognizes OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED apps
2. It looks for specific file structures (like wp-config.php for WordPress)
3. Your Node.js app (index.js, package.json) is NOT recognized
4. If you try to "Add Installation" with your Node.js files:
   → Error: "Failed to add installation. No supported app found."

================================================================================
WHAT APP INSTALLER DOES
================================================================================

When you use App Installer for WordPress:

1. ✅ Downloads WordPress files
2. ✅ Creates database automatically
3. ✅ Configures wp-config.php
4. ✅ Sets up admin account
5. ✅ Manages updates
6. ✅ Provides management interface

For Node.js:
- ❌ Doesn't download Node.js runtime
- ❌ Doesn't recognize package.json
- ❌ Doesn't execute node index.js
- ❌ Doesn't manage Node.js processes

VISUAL COMPARISON
================================================================================

APP INSTALLER FOR WORDPRESS:
----------------------------
App Installer → Recognizes WordPress → Downloads files → Configures → ✅ Running

APP INSTALLER FOR NODE.JS:
--------------------------
App Installer → Looks for supported app → Doesn't find WordPress/Joomla/etc. → ❌ Error

================================================================================
WHAT YOU CAN DO INSTEAD
================================================================================

OPTION 1: Check if Node.js is Available Elsewhere
---------------------------------------------------
1. Go to: SiteGround → Devs
2. Look for:
   - "Node.js" (separate from App Installer)
   - "Application Manager" (different from App Installer)
   - "Runtime Environments"
   - "Custom Applications"

If you see any of these, Node.js might be available!

OPTION 2: Contact SiteGround Support
-------------------------------------
Ask them:
- "Can I run a custom Node.js application on my account?"
- "Is Node.js available outside of App Installer?"
- "What are my options for Node.js?"

They might:
- Say no (most likely)
- Offer upgrade to VPS
- Show you hidden features

OPTION 3: Use Railway.app (Recommended)
----------------------------------------
1. Sign up: railway.app (free)
2. Deploy your backend (5 minutes)
3. Get URL
4. Update frontend .env
5. ✅ Done!

This is the easiest and most reliable option.

OPTION 4: SSH Workaround (Not Recommended)
-------------------------------------------
1. Enable SSH
2. Install Node.js manually
3. Run via SSH
4. ⚠️ Unstable, may die

================================================================================
TEST IT YOURSELF
================================================================================

You can try (but it won't work):

1. Go to: SiteGround → Devs → App Installer
2. Click: "Add Installation" or "Install New Application"
3. Point to: api.enalyze.123fixit.com/public_html
4. Result: ❌ "Failed to add installation. No supported app found."

This confirms: App Installer doesn't support Node.js.

================================================================================
WHY APP INSTALLER EXISTS
================================================================================

App Installer is for:
- ✅ Quick setup of popular PHP apps
- ✅ Automatic configuration
- ✅ Easy management
- ✅ One-click installs

It's NOT for:
- ❌ Custom applications
- ❌ Node.js backends
- ❌ Any non-PHP apps

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

Since App Installer doesn't support Node.js:

1. ✅ Check SiteGround → Devs for other Node.js options
2. ✅ Contact support to confirm
3. ✅ If no, use Railway.app (5 minutes, free, reliable)

Don't waste time trying to make App Installer work with Node.js - it's not designed for that!

================================================================================
SUMMARY
================================================================================

❓ "Can we add Node.js in App Installer?"

✅ ANSWER: ❌ NO

- App Installer = For pre-built PHP apps (WordPress, Joomla, etc.)
- Your Node.js app = Custom application
- App Installer doesn't recognize it
- You'll get error: "No supported app found"

SOLUTION: Use Railway.app instead (5 minutes, free, works perfectly!)
